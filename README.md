# Constructor

For my Object-Oriented Programming class, CS246 in Spring 2023, my team of 3 and I created a Waterloo version of Settles of Catan called Constructor. Using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in C++, we ensured low coupling and high cohesion, adhering to OOP principles and modularization and implementing a bonus feature of no possible memory leakage through smart pointers. This command-line game includes more complex rules, players, and resources than the original Catan, earning us 109% including the bonus feature.

Due to academic integrity, source code is only available upon request. You can find the uploaded UML in this repo.
